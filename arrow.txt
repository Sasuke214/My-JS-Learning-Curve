Arrow Function

Eg 1.
var d = (a) => a+1;
var e = x => x+1;
var f = () => { return; }

Eg 2.
var g = () => ({})



-> Used to eradicate function keyword
-> In one line function, no need to return.
-> If multiple lines are there, then has to be kept in braces.
-> If there was single parameter, then no need to put in brace.
-> There is no arguments, this and super keyword within arrow function.
-> this keyword will always refer to global window inside arrow function.
-> While creating empty object if u write a program then always wrap in (). Eg no 2.
