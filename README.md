## JS ES6

  let var_name1,...,var_namen;
  let var_name = value1;
  
  ```
  
  1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

	
..* It's Scope is only within the block where it is defined or declared;
 Will leads to reference error until it is initialized; ( Will be in temporal dead zone)
 Hoisting will not work
..* Cannot be declared more than once within the same block, for eg: switch;
..* Can be used as a private variable for a block, which can only be assessed with functions or var
   iables within that block.
